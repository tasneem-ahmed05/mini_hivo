# Experiment 20 — Reproduce Locally

## Fixed inputs

Baseline `d15b6068f78dd5b9e46daacd81f5543af5c2cf89` includes Experiment 19.
Treatment implementation `a91062551c9b346a35eb4abb5f18a6f64f95a72b` is local.
Both objects must exist in Git. Use existing Python 3.11+ and Mini Hivo test
dependencies. Do not install/download anything for this protocol.

The fixture is [experiment20_scope.json](../../tests/fixtures/experiment20_scope.json).
It has original stored goals/root requirements and **declared synthetic local
conditions**, not recovered original mission payloads. Scoped Git attributes
preserve its LF bytes. [manifest.json](manifest.json) records canonical source
and fixture hashes. Production/fixture drift is rejected by the probe.

## Paired controlled comparison

From repository root, choose a new external output directory:

```powershell
python -B scripts/experiment20_probe.py --output-dir <fresh-paired-directory>
```

This runs twelve selected assertions in separate processes, using the baseline
module loaded from `git show` and the pinned treatment checkout. It does not
check out or modify another worktree. Browser observations and provider seams
are controlled; production applicability, profile, snapshot evaluation and
related routing execute normally. No browser or model runs. Full per-arm logs
are local; the small comparison JSON is publishable.

## Selected treatment regressions

```powershell
python -B scripts/experiment20_validate.py --output-dir <fresh-selected-directory>
```

This runs thirteen suites/176 methods on the recorded source. Unexpected live
model/provider calls raise. There is a 180-second cap per suite; no application
or browser runner is invoked. Outputs include per-suite logs and results JSON.
Temporary files use the output directory's private `tmp` subdirectory.

For focused development only:

```powershell
python -B scripts/experiment20_validate.py --focused-only --output-dir <fresh-focused-directory>
```

The 34-method new suite is a subset of the 176; do not add the counts.

## Existing-suite baseline control

```powershell
python -B scripts/experiment20_validate.py --baseline-existing --output-dir <fresh-baseline-directory>
```

This runs the twelve existing suites/142 methods with exact baseline `mini.py`
loaded in memory and provider calls blocked. Inherited dependencies other than
the new scope module are unchanged. The new module is not used by baseline.
The baseline control does not claim the new Experiment 20 tests pass.

## Review

```text
git diff d15b6068f78dd5b9e46daacd81f5543af5c2cf89 --check
git diff d15b6068f78dd5b9e46daacd81f5543af5c2cf89 --name-only
```

Review only this dependency-relative delta for Experiment 20. A future team
main comparison may include unmerged inherited work and requires a separate
publication decision. Everything here remains local; do not push/merge as part
of reproduction.

Passing controlled snapshots do not establish physical browser behavior, new
game code, all detailed user acceptance criteria or live E2E completion. Missing
historical fixtures are a disclosed gap, not permission to weaken a test.
